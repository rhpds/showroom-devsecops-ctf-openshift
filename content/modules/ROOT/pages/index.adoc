= {lab_name} : A Capture The Flag game.

This lab is a Capture The Flag (CTF) game.
A flag is an element of information related to security, such as a password, an IP address... that has to be discovered in a "mission".

This CTF has 4 missions, so there are 4 flags to discover.
The missions are in order.  
You need to complete one mission and submit its flag to unlock the next one.

The briefing and first mission are described on the next page.
Successive missions are described directly by the dashboard when they are unlocked.

== Winning the CTF

To win, you must collect a maximum number of points.
Each discovered flag brings you 100 points.
To help you go faster from a mission to another, you can use the hints provided by the dashboard.
Each hint, however, will cost 10 points.

Good luck !
